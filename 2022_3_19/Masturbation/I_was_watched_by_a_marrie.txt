										I was watched by a married woman and loved it

When I was in my early 20s, I was travelling through Europe with friends. 

One afternoon, after spending all day on the beach, I was in my room, getting ready to go out for dinner after having a shower. Because I was sunburnt, I was naked, putting on aloe. 

I must have been a couple of minutes in, when I noticed that a woman was watching me from her balcony. Her place was divided from mine by a narrow laneway. The kind you walk or drive a moped down. No car would fit. 

She was literally only a few metres away from my window. She was mid 30s and hot. I didn’t stop. I looked her in the eyes and continued to rub the aloe into my skin. 

She smiled, waved, and watched. After another minute she made the hand moving gesture, indicating “jerk off”. I didnt speak Spanish, she probably had low or no English, but I knew what she was asking. 

She took a step back into her room, so she was out of the eyes of anyone walking past, and pulled the front of her dress down, showing me her breasts. At 22, that was all I needed. I jerked off, she watched and rubbed her breasts. 

A man called out to her. Her expression showed panic. That’s when I realised she was married. I finished up quick so she could see. She was so turned on.  It was very hot.
